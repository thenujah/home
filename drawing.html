		<!--Drawing Topic-->
		<h3 style="background-color: Tomato;">Drawing!</h3>
		<p>I love anything that has to do with colouring or painting because it is very relaxing and calming. Whenver I'm stressed, painting helps me feel more relaxed because you are expressing yourself in all sorts of pictures and colours.</p>
		<p>I specifically love to draw zentangles. I love to draw zentangles because it's something where you draw  many designs of your choice freely. The designs can range from being very complex or even very simple. Also you can draw these designs within a bigger picture such as the feather below. </p>
